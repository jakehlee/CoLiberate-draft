				<h2>1  Our Goal</h2>
				<p>We want groups and individuals to adopt and adapt technologies that respect and support the traditions, customs, and priorities present in their particular community/society.</p>

				<h2>2  Our History</h2>
				<p>Mohamed, a founding member of CoLiberate, manages Columbia Makerspace, which is community run by volunteers know as Superusers. Although this model has been successful for promoting a burgeoning community of student makers at Columbia, opening up to the public is impossible due to university regulations. <br>
				<br>
				As we believe Making should not be restriced to well-funded private spaces, we were determined to bring the success of a community led makerspace to a wider audience, and NYC Makerspace was the result. <br>
				<br>
				We teamed up with the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation to create a system of makerspaces that serve as a foundation for social, scientific, and artistic innovation that originates in the local neighborhood. <br>
				<br>
				We've found that space and tool access control is an issue for not just Columbia and NYC Makerspace but a universal issue for many labs, fabrication locations, and co-working spaces. Therefore, we built CoLiberate Swipe.</p>

				<h2>3  Our Future</h2>
				<p>
					Through NYC Makerspace, our team has trained local high school and alternative to incarceration students in programing, design, and fabrication skills. Our goal is to employee interested students that have completed this program for the production and assembly of CoLiberate Swipe.
